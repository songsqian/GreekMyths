Robert Graves' \textit{The Greek Myths} was in a style that is not
very appealing to me. In each chapter, Graves presenta description of
a myth, followed by some notes.  To make the reading more effective, I
tried to turn the description and the notes into diagrams, so that I
can picture the connections among all the difficult-to-pronounce
names. As a result, the reading became a prolonged project, which
helped me to learn the used of the \LaTeX\ \texttt{tikz} package.
